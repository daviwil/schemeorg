Scheme is a classic programming language in the [Lisp
family](<//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)>). It
emphasizes [functional
programming](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) and
[domain-specific languages](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaprogramming)
but adapts to other styles. Known for its clean and minimalist design,
Scheme is one of the longest-lived and best-studied [dynamic
languages](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language) with
many fast and portable implementations.
